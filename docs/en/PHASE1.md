### Step 7: Wrap-up

## UI/UX Patterns

### Arrow-Key Navigation

**All menus use arrow keys** - no typing required:
- ↑↓ - Navigate options
- Space - Toggle selection (multi-select menus)
- Enter - Confirm selection

### Multi-Select Menus

Visual indicators:
- `[x]` - Selected
- `[ ]` - Not selected
- `[-]` - Disabled (cannot be changed)
- `▸` - Current cursor position

Color coding:
- Cyan - Selected items
- Gray - Disabled items
- Bold - Current item

### Status Messages

- ✅ `Done` - Green, successful completion
- ⏭️ `Skipped` - Yellow, intentionally skipped
- ❌ `Failed` - Red, error occurred (with solution)

---

## Error Handling

### Node.js Installation Failed

**Critical error** - Phase 1 cannot complete without Node.js:

```
❌ Node.js installation failed

Node.js is required for AI coding tools.

Please install manually:
  brew install node

Then verify:
  node --version
```

Script exits and provides manual installation instructions.

### Package Installation Failed

**Non-critical** - Phase 1 continues:

```
⚠️ ripgrep installation returned error, continuing...
```

Logs warning but doesn't stop the installation process.

### Terminal Profile Import Failed

**Recoverable** - Provides manual instructions:

```
⚠️ Terminal profile import failed

📋 Please import manually:
   Terminal > Settings (⌘,) > Profiles > Import...
   Select: /path/to/Dev.terminal
```

### Homebrew Not Available

**Critical for macOS** - Cannot proceed without package manager:

```
❌ Homebrew not available

Please install Homebrew first:
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Then re-run this script.
```

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Requirements (Phase 1 Complete)
- ✅ Package manager installed (Homebrew/winget)
- ✅ Node.js installed and working
- ✅ Phase 2 files copied to `~/claude-code-setup/`
- ✅ Installation directory cleaned up

### Optional Success
- ⚪ Terminal theme applied (user choice)

## What's Next?

After Phase 1, you can:

1. **Proceed to Phase 2** (recommended for Claude Code users)
   - Claude Code CLI installation
   - Shared agents installation
   - MCP servers configuration

2. **Skip Phase 2 and start coding**
   - You have a complete development environment
   - Terminal is configured with theme and plugins
   - Shell aliases are ready to use

3. **Run Phase 2 later**
   - Anytime: `~/claude-code-setup/setup-claude.sh`
   - Language preference is saved
